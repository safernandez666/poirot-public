# poirot-data   — shared between hawk-scanner and dashboard (alerts.db, scan output)
# poirot-config — writable config files (connection.yml, .env) shared by both pods
#
# ⚠  ReadWriteOnce requires both pods to land on the same node.
#    For multi-node clusters use a ReadWriteMany StorageClass (NFS, Longhorn, etc.)
#    and change accessModes accordingly.
